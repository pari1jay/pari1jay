## Projects üöÄ

### 1. Drug Efficacy Prediction Model 
- Developed machine learning models to predict HIV drug efficacy using a pre-processed dataset (CA, CM, CI classes) 
from Moleculenet.ai, performing stratified random splitting (80% train, 20% test). 
- Extracted 1D/2D/3D molecular descriptors (e.g., logP, Morgan Fingerprints, MORSE) from graph-structured molecules, 
training base models and stacking them with cross-validation for enhanced predictions. 
- Implemented a Graph Convolutional Network to learn neural fingerprints from molecular structures, and a CNN 
(InceptionV3 backbone) on SMILES strings for representation learning, optimizing drug efficacy classification.  
- Evaluated models using accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen‚Äôs kappa, aligning predictive insights with clinical research 
objectives. 

### 2. MULTI-CLASS GENRE CLASSIFICATION  using R [Link](https://github.com/pari1jay/Spotify-classification-R)
- Automatic genre classification has long captivated researchers in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), seeking techniques to unravel the musical diversity. 
- audio feature extraction and music genre classification by utilizing Spotify's rich array of audio features and a diverse dataset.
- Few other projects exploring concepts in R [Link](https://rpubs.com/Pari__)


### 3. Consumer Complaints Prediction
- **Tools**: Python, NLP, Data Visualization  
- **Description**: Applied NLP techniques to analyze customer feedback and classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. Achieved **79% accuracy** using machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN).  


### 4. Real Estate Sales Prediction Web Application
- **Tools**: Python, Machine Learning, Streamlit  
- **Description**: Developed a web app to predict real estate sales using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Enabled city-specific and overall sales predictions with user input.  
 

### 5. ETL and Data Pipelines with Shell, Airflow and Kafka
- **Tools**: Shell, Airflow and Kafka
- **Description**: Designed and implemented ETL pipelines to integrate data from multiple sources into a centralized data warehouse, improving data quality by **25%**.
