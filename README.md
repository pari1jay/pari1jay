## Projects üöÄ

### 1. Efficacy Prediction Model 
- Check Efficacy using a pre-processed dataset (CA, CM, CI classes) from [Moleculenet.ai](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/spaces/NCIDTPdata/pages/158204006/AIDS+Antiviral+Screen+Data)
- Merge Data: Link NSC across files to combine screening results, EC50/IC50, and structures.
- Filter Compounds: Focus on CA/CM for active candidates.
- Calculate Selectivity Index (SI): SI = IC50/EC50 to identify compounds with high efficacy and low toxicity.
  
- Data preprocessing :
  - Manage duplicate entries,
  - Mismatched screening conclusions,
  - flag interpretation sign to values and
  - Handle missing data.
    
- ML model: performing random splitting (80% train, 20% test). 
- Extracted molecular descriptors (e.g., logP, Morgan Fingerprints, MORSE) from data, 
- training base models, check with test data/.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen‚Äôs kappa, aligning predictive insights with clinical research 
objectives. 

### 2. MULTI-CLASS GENRE CLASSIFICATION  using R [Link](https://github.com/pari1jay/Spotify-classification-R)
- Automatic genre classification has long captivated researchers in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), seeking techniques to unravel the musical diversity. 
- audio feature extraction and music genre classification by utilizing Spotify's rich array of audio features and a diverse dataset.
- Few other projects exploring concepts in R [Link](https://rpubs.com/Pari__)


### 3. Consumer Complaints Prediction
- **Tools**: Python, NLP, Data Visualization  
- **Description**: Applied NLP techniques to analyze customer feedback and classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. Achieved **79% accuracy** using machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN).  


### 4. Real Estate Sales Prediction Web Application
- **Tools**: Python, Machine Learning, Streamlit  
- **Description**: Developed a web app to predict real estate sales using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Enabled city-specific and overall sales predictions with user input.  
 

### 5. ETL and Data Pipelines with Shell, Airflow and Kafka
- **Tools**: Shell, Airflow and Kafka
- **Description**: Designed and implemented ETL pipelines to integrate data from multiple sources into a centralized data warehouse, improving data quality by **25%**.  
- **Coursera**: [Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/etl-and-data-pipelines-shell-airflow-kafka/home/)
