## About Me
I'm a **Data Analyst** with experience in data engineering, system integration, and cloud-based solutions. I specialize in designing and implementing scalable data pipelines, optimizing ETL processes, and leveraging cloud platforms to deliver data-driven insights. I have a **Master of Science degree in Applied Data Science** from **Indiana University**, and I am passionate about data analytics, machine learning, and cloud computing. I'm actively seeking opportunities to contribute to impactful projects as a **Data Analyst** or **Data Engineer**.  

When I'm not working with data, I love learning new technologies, spending time with animals, and sneaking in a chapter or two of a fictional novel during breaks.
